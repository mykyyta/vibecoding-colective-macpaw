# Quest Leaderboard Status

## Packet Status

| Packet | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product direction | Complete | Product apex now treats leaderboard entries as durable product data. |
| Technical direction | Complete | Stack docs prefer Express API + DynamoDB for persistent leaderboard storage. |
| External review | Complete | Product and engineering reviews found the original contract packet under-specified. |
| Planning | Complete | Brief now contains five packets, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and validation. |
| Contract hardening | Complete | Shared types, quest-session token shape, DynamoDB schema, env names, validation rules, and architecture docs are recorded. |
| Storage proof | Complete | Local proof script validates newest-first `createdKey` ordering and invalid input handling. |
| Backend API | Complete | Routes, validation, signed completion-token proof, DynamoDB boundary, and local API proof are implemented. |
| Completion UI | Complete | Left-screen leaderboard view, neutral screen control, post-completion name entry, and leaderboard API calls are implemented. |
| Cloud configuration | Complete | DynamoDB table is active and Terraform plan is clean. |
| Cloud deploy | Complete | Railway backend and CloudFront frontend are deployed and smoke-tested. |

## Current Handoff

Cloud deploy is complete. Public URL:
`https://d1uswfdwd46dyc.cloudfront.net`.

## Validation

- `npm run typecheck` passed for Contract Hardening.
- `git diff --check` passed for Contract Hardening.
- `npm run test:leaderboard-storage` passed for Storage Proof.
- `npm run typecheck` passed after Storage Proof.
- `git diff --check` passed after Storage Proof.
- `npm run test:leaderboard-api` passed for Backend API.
- `npm run test:leaderboard-storage` passed after Backend API.
- `npm run build` passed after Backend API.
- `git diff --check` passed after Backend API.
- `npm run typecheck` passed for Completion UI.
- `npm run build` passed for Completion UI.
- Desktop screenshots captured at `1440x900`, including the expanded leaderboard.
- Mobile screenshots captured at `390x844`, including the expanded leaderboard.
- `npm run test:leaderboard-api` passed after Completion UI.
- `npm run test:leaderboard-storage` passed after Completion UI.
- `git diff --check` passed after Completion UI.
- `npm run build` passed after the left-screen leaderboard redesign.
- Desktop and mobile screenshots captured after the left-screen leaderboard
  redesign.
- `npm run test:leaderboard-api` passed after the left-screen leaderboard
  redesign.
- `npm run test:leaderboard-storage` passed after the left-screen leaderboard
  redesign.
- `git diff --check` passed after the left-screen leaderboard redesign.
- `terraform -chdir=infra validate` passed after adding the DynamoDB table.
- `AWS_PROFILE=thehrdwood npm run infra:plan` showed one DynamoDB table create
  and no destroys.
- `AWS_PROFILE=thehrdwood npm run infra:apply` updated CloudFront TLS but failed
  on DynamoDB `CreateTable` with IAM `AccessDenied`.
- After IAM permissions were added, `AWS_PROFILE=thehrdwood npm run infra:apply`
  created `vibecoding-colective-macpaw-leaderboard`.
- `aws dynamodb describe-table` confirmed the leaderboard table is `ACTIVE` with
  `PAY_PER_REQUEST` billing and keys `leaderboardId` + `createdKey`.
- `AWS_PROFILE=thehrdwood terraform -chdir=infra plan -var-file=app.tfvars`
  returned `No changes`.
- Railway variables were configured for DynamoDB-backed leaderboard storage.
- `npm run deploy:railway` deployed the backend successfully.
- Railway `/health` returned `{"ok":true}`.
- Railway `/api/leaderboard?limit=3` returned an empty newest-first leaderboard.
- `AWS_PROFILE=thehrdwood npm run deploy:cloudfront` uploaded frontend assets
  and created CloudFront invalidation `ICG0RNUFYA5L7GQLHVOJ3L4551`.
- CloudFront invalidation completed.
- CloudFront `/`, `/health`, `/api/status`, and `/api/leaderboard?limit=3`
  smoke tests passed.

## Risks

- DynamoDB and cloud deployment can incur cost; external resource creation needs
  explicit approval.
- Display names are user-provided content; validate length and render safely.
- Do not store raw voice transcripts or unnecessary personal data.
