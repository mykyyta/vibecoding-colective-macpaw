## Notes

An accidental deploy was started against the existing Pult `web` service because
the first local script defaulted to `web`. It was restored from the Pult `main`
worktree and is now `SUCCESS` on deployment
`83fcb31c-5920-4867-bbec-e7bc1723e773`. The local script now defaults to
`vibecoding-colective-macpaw`.
